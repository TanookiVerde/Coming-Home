A chilling wind blows in the late afternoon. You catch sight of the house that you have to evaluate. The house scares you and you try to gain some confidence: "Ok Carlos, it is just another house to evaluate. You've done this on hundreds houses before. Just get in, see all the rooms, and get out. Very simple.". Still, the fact that it is the only house in the street gives signs that something is wrong.

It seems to be a normal kitchen, but not used for a lonf time. There are rotten food in the cabinet and a few dead rats on the floor. The smell is intolerable. You feel seasick only by staying in this room.

You can see Green door, Orange door, Furnace (on which is old pressure cooker), Simple Table (on which are an Orange key and dirty napkin) and Cabinet (empty) here.

The unidentified noise is still coming from the Garage.

The monster begins to walk in your direction. You are mesmerized and can't move a muscle. The statue grabs you neck with both hands and starts to hang you. You hear the dog in the porch barking. You see the hand of the statue going up and them down in your dirrection. And then everything goes dark...

Then things become worse. It is like your soul was taken off your body and travelled in an infinite speed. You see thousands of things and nothing at the same time.

Medium Bedroom
This room gives an impression that it is the core of the house, but you don't know why. Another corpse is in the bed, however there is no stink. The corpse seens prety different from the others.

You can see Heart-painted door here.

Entering in the last room of the house, you think nothing can surprise you any longer. You are wrong. You see the most bizarre scene you have ever seen. An old woman, with her skin as white as snow is laid on the bed. A dozen of tree branches are invading her body. Your first thought is that she is dead. But you see she trying to breathe, almost suffocating, while the branches are changing color as if they were taken energy from that old woman.
 Only after a few seconds you see another person standing in the room. The scene was so shocking that you didn't notice him before. It is Charles. When you start to feel a little better for being a familiar face, he starts to talk. His voice is totally different now. He revels that he is no homeless. He always lived in that house, and the woman laid in the bed is his mother. You notice that his right hand is behind his back.
 He tells you that the house needs to be feed. That "she" needs a host. And her mother is no longer strong enough. He moves his right hand, and you can see that he is holding a piece of wood with nails. He runs towards you prepared to attack.
You defend yourself putting your write arm in front of your face. The man hits your arm with an unnatural strength and the nails trespasses your skin. You instantly move your arm. The piece of wood is wiped off Charles" hands and is now on the floor. The man is coming once again in your direction. You try to get to the piece of wood, but it is too late. His hands are already involving your neck. There is no point in trying to escape, he is way stronger than you. He raises you in the air and strangles you. Your vision is now blurry. You hear the dog in the porch barking. You still try to hit him in the chest a moment before you fainted.
 When you woke up, you see you are in the same room where the fight took place. You try to move but your body does not answer your commands any longer. You look around and you are laid on the bed, with tree branches all over you body. You try to scream, but you have no voice. You are now part of the bed.

 BAD ENDING.

Kitchen
It seems to be a normal kitchen, but not used for a long time. There are rotten food in the cabinet and a few dead rats on the floor. The smell is intolerable. You feel seasick only by staying in this room.

You can see Green door, Orange door, Furnace (on which is old pressure cooker), Simple Table (on which are an Orange key and dirty napkin) and Cabinet (empty) here.

The garage is fully of rotten boxes. A weak light beam comes from a small window. The smell is bad, but is a relief compared to the kitchen.

You can see Brown door, Orange door, deflated ball, wooden planks and a homeless here.

Interesting... there is a homeless here!

The homeless introduced himself to you and his name is Charles.

Kitchen
It seems to be a normal kitchen, but not used for a long time. There are rotten food in the cabinet and a few dead rats on the floor. The smell is intolerable. You feel seasick only by staying in this room.

You can see Green door, Orange door, Furnace (on which is old pressure cooker), Simple Table (on which are an Orange key and dirty napkin) and Cabinet (empty) here.

Taken.

You unlock Orange door.

(first opening Orange door)
Garage
The garage is fully of rotten boxes. A weak light beam comes from a small window. The smell is bad, but is a relief compared to the kitchen.

You can see Brown door, Orange door, deflated ball, wooden planks and a homeless here.

Interesting... there is a homeless here!

The homeless introduced himself to you and his name is Charles.
Maybe he has something to tell you...

You saved the dog from the trap. He is very thankful.

A chill runs up your spine

I should examine it.

Giving a closer look on the photo you see two kids, a boy and a girl, with their parents. Behind them, there is a house being constructed.

(first opening Red door)

Living Room
This room is oddly empty, like a hurricane has passed by removing all the furniture. Only 4 doors can be seen.

You can see White door, Red door, Brown door and Yellow door here.

Dining Room
The dining room looks like to be more conserved than the other rooms. The forniture is fancy, but very strange.

You can see Yellow door, Green door, Large Wooden Table (on which is fresh apple), Old Chair and Shelf (on which is strange photograph) here.

Suddenly, the apple begins to rot in your hands, the radio turn on and start to play strange sounds. You can hear strange heart beats coming from the eletronic device.

It seems to be a normal kitchen, but not used for a long time. There are rotten food in the cabinet and a few dead rats on the floor. The smell is intolerable. You feel seasick only by staying in this room.

You put the finger inside the mirror. It disappears. You put your hole hand and it also disappears. You don't think twice. You enter with all your body in the mirror. First you start to fell dizzy. Then things become worse. It is like your soul was taken off your body and travelled in an infinite speed. You see thousands of things and nothing at the same time. You cannot know if 5 seconds has passed or 5 days. It is the most painful sensation you have ever experienced.

Medium Bedroom
This room gives an impression that it is the core of the house, but you don't know why. Another corpse is in the bed, however there is no stink. The corpse seens prety different from the others.

You can see Heart-painted door here.

Entering in the last room of the house, you think nothing can surprise you any longer. You are wrong. You see the most bizarre scene you have ever seen. An old woman, with her skin as white as snow is laid on the bed. A dozen of tree branches are invading her body. Your first thought is that she is dead. But you see she trying to breathe, almost suffocating, while the branches are changing color as if they were taken energy from that old woman.
 Only after a few seconds you see another person standing in the room. The scene was so shocking that you didn't notice him before. It is Charles. When you start to feel a little better for being a familiar face, he starts to talk. His voice is totally different now. He revels that he is no homeless. He always lived in that house, and the woman laid in the bed is his mother. You notice that his right hand is behind his back.
 He tells you that the house needs to be feed. That "she" needs a host. And her mother is no longer strong enough. He moves his right hand, and you can see that he is holding a piece of wood with nails. He runs towards you prepared to attack.
Suddenly, the dog you helped before appears behind you and protect you from the Charles" attack. He bites the arm of the man and the man screams of pain and fall on the floor. You profited his position to kick him in the face, knocking him out. The dog runs through the door, in direction of the exit and you follow him.
 You escaped from the most dangerous situation that you have ever lived or will live. Thanks to your kind soul, you helped a poor animal before entering the house. This dog never forgot you and in your greatest need, he was there to help you. Congratulations Carlos. You have visited all the rooms in the house and completed your job. But, most important, you now have a companion dog.

 GOOD ENDING. Congratulations!
